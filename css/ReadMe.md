# This is some CSS exercise based on the FreeCodeCamp
## From day 1 to day n
## Notes here:
### day1:
* adding time to the paragraph and time input box
* animation: move around, disappear
* accesskey feature: press alt for GChrome to access button/link
* tabindex: use tab to come to the part following index

Responsive Part:

* mediaquery: @media: set range to change style
* make the pic responsive: max-width:100%; height:auto;
* change the pic's size: width;height
* display:flex to make responsive

Here is the flex part:

* flex-direction to adjust how column or row it arranges
* justify-content: to change the location of the certain item
* flex: flex-grow flex-shrink flex basis
* order: define the order of the parts

### day2:
* Here is a useful color page: https://nipponcolors.com/
* To change the space between two bullet paragraph, margin could be used.
* margin: top-right-bottom-left
* margin form: t-rl-b, tb-rl
* padding: instead of non-color as margin, padding has a color
